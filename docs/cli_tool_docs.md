# Vertex CLI

Vertex CLI is a powerful command-line tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer queries and debug faster. With just a few commands, you can set up and start using advanced features like querying LLMs and generating insights.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get started:

### Install Vertex-CLI from TestPyPI

To install [`Vertex-CLI`](https://github.com/prathamhole14/vertex-cli) from TestPyPI, run:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Vertex-CLI
```

After installation, initialize the CLI configuration file:

## Configuration

You can configure the CLI to use a specific LLM model by adding or updating your API key:

```bash

```

Replace `gemini-flash-latest` with your preferred model name and `YOUR_MODEL_API_KEY` with your API key.

To list all configured models:

```bash
tex list
```

To remove a model:

```bash
tex remove gemini-flash-lite-latest
```

To select a model as the default:

```bash
tex select gemini-flash-latest
```
